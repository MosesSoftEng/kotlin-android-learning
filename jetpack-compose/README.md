# Jetpack Compose
Toolkit for building native Android UI using composable functions which define your app's UI programmatically by describing how it should look and providing data dependencies, rather than focusing on the process of the UI's construction (initializing an element, attaching it to a parent, etc.)

## Why Jetpack Compose
Simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.

## Create a compsable function using @Composable annotation
